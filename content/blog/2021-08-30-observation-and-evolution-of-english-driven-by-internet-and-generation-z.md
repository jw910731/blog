I just find out the Generation Z had create hundreds of new phrases and words in English. This impact dramatically affect the language itself and also its users.

Few minutes before writing this posts, I use the word "mispost" in Github issue tracker to explain that we need to develop the delete function of my working project. The spell checker immediately draw the conspicuous (meaning very unpleasant and noticeable.) red underline on my "mispost". The word mispost had been recorded to Urban Dictionary. Meaning I'm not the only one using this word. But that old stubborn system still draw a stupid wavy red line under my "mispost" during writing this post.

I think this might caused by the dramatic growing English phrases and words. In the past, most commonly used word are develop in a quite slow speed in contrast to nowadays. (Except when William Shakespeare writing his plays. He had develop too much words.) The spell checker developers are used to design the system that memorize every phrases and words and checking them in a rather simple logic, but this is not suitable now. Too much new commonly used word had flooded into the language. The spell checker software is unable to update fast enough to handle this kind of situation, not to mention those poor English users who are going to adapt all of these by linguistic instincts. ( "linguistic instinct" here references that some people believe human brain are "preinstalled" with the ability to learn language structure.)

The network had accelerate the connection of peoples. Culture, societies, and other things that worked, grew, evolved slowly in the past are drastically changing nowadays. This is a astonishing and magnificent phenomenon, and it is in displayed in front of us. Even more, we are a part of it. We shall wait and see h0w th!ngs will go and..... (I felt sleepy and there's nothing worth to say. It's time for you to think, and talk about the impact and how you feel in this flood of internet connection.)

## Post script
To talk about a topic related to English. I think using Chinese to discuss it would be weird. Writing in English is hard. (Compare to Chinese, there's too much words have similar meaning but had slight difference between them.)

During the writing process, to enhance the precision of word usage. I almost checkout every word I used in dictionary, reads their definition and synonyms to find the most suitable word to fully express what I mean and eliminate as much possibility of misleading my readers as I could.

Sentences are constantly checking after they were written. To ensure they are in a good shape.

It is such a tiring work to talk about culture evolution, but I think it is crucial for us to aware and observe the tendency of our "communication infrastructure", language. These topics and problems are gaining attraction in Traditional Chinese user community. Due to the cultural dissonance between Traditional Chinese culture and Simplified Chinese culture which the latter is a stronger culture, and the former is more historical. But for English users, maybe these kind of topic and problem is less discussed in contrast to Traditional Chinese community.
